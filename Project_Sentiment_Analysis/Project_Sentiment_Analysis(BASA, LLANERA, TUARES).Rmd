 Trend Analysis

data_filtered <- data_filtered %>% 
  filter(datetime >= as.POSIXct("2022-10-28 00:00:00") & datetime <= as.POSIXct("2022-10-30 23:59:59"))

# **Trend Analysis Insights:**
# The tweet activity mentioning BLACKPINK and its members between October 28 and October 30, 2022, shows a gradual increase from October 28 to October 29, followed by a sharp spike on October 30. 
# This surge in activity coincides with discussions about the Itaewon tragedy and BLACKPINK’s decision to proceed with their Houston concert. 
# The contrast in opinions likely heightened public interest, as the conversation became polarized between those critical of the group and those offering support. 
# This spike also highlights the influential role of social media, where high-profile events and controversies tend to dominate discussions.

    sentiment < 0 ~ "Negative",
    TRUE ~ "Neutral"

# **Sentiment Analysis Insights:**
# Sentiment analysis of the tweets reveals that negative sentiment was the most dominant during this period. 
# A significant number of tweets expressed disapproval of BLACKPINK and their management for continuing with the Houston concert in light of the Itaewon tragedy. 
# Upon further examination, some of the negative sentiment appeared to be driven by online trolls amplifying the criticism. 
# While positive sentiments were less common, they reflected fan support for BLACKPINK and sympathy for the victims of the Itaewon incident. 
# Neutral sentiment was the least common, as most tweets conveyed strong emotional responses regarding both the tragedy and the group’s concert.
